    "Our python code is pretty cool on it's own, but if we want it to be accessible to the public we need to do a bit more work! Before we jump right into Alexa, let's develop a Python web server to complement your skills! There are several Python frameworks that allow for rapid web development, but we will be using Flask particularly because of Flask-Ask, the Python framework for rapid Alexa Skills Kit development that we will work with later in the course. For now, let's get familiar with Flask. Let's install it- in the same way we've been installing pretty much everything :)  \n",

For example, if you would like a website that has a login and several tabs in a navbar, you should install Flask's login and user authentication extensions and consider making templates for user login/logout/signup as well as a template for what a general page might look like. In any situation where you might be incorporating a similar structure in multiple elements of your website, make a template! \n",
